  # OAuth GitHub Callback
  
  This endpoint is called by GitHub after user authorization.
  
  ## Parameters:
  - `code`: Authorization code from GitHub
  - `state`: State parameter for security
  
  ## Expected Response:
  - **Success**: 302 Redirect to frontend with tokens
  - **Failure**: 302 Redirect to `/auth/failure`
  
  ## Note:
  This endpoint is typically called automatically by GitHub during OAuth flow.
  For testing, you can simulate it with a valid authorization code.
